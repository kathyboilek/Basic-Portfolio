				<p>My background includes serving as a Business Analyst/SharePoint developer for several years. I base my success with the network I built while I was with Emerson. I  strongly believe meeting face-to-face, when possible, creates a bond that will follow you throughout your career. </p>
			
				<p>I have the ability to provide clear direction, and understands the value of building and adhering to a company's brand positioning, assuring that vision and mission statements are well supported. Effectively communicating needs for a project, especially to outside resources. I am told that it is just one of my talents which contributes to creative solutions and successful implementation. </p>
